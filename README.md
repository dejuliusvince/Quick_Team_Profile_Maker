# Quick_Team_Profiler

## Description 

This application allows a team manager to create a quick, easy, and well-formatted HTML document displaying a simple profile of their team members. The app uses jest to test its libraries and inquirer to give prompts to the user where they can enter in their team members necessary information.

Each team generated will have one manager, and once the manager has been created the user will have the option to add engineers and interns to the team. All employees will have their id and email included in their generated HTMl card. Engineers will also have a link to their github profile, and interns' cards will display the school that they are currently attending.
